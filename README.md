# movies

After running the project, visit http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html to experiment with the API and also visit http://localhost:8080/h2-console/ to see how your experimenting changed the database.  Database credentials are located in the application.proporties file.  

Keep in mind that in order to read a csv file into H2, the original data set needed to be reformatted.  Therefore there are ten records in the IMBD-Movie-Data.csv file as reformatting 1000 records was outside the scope of this project.  Review IMBD-Movie-Data.csv file in the resources folder to view original datasource that spring ingests upon starting.
